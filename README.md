Research project on a robot able to move to goal point by overcoming obstacles and detect any object in the goal point


The project uses Raspberry Pi as the main controller
The robot is desired to have 2 objectives, 1) being able to go to the goal point without any collision with any objects 2) detecting objects in the goal point.

For the 1st objective we use the A star algorithm and for the 2nd objective we use the Tiny-Yolov3 object detection algorithm
